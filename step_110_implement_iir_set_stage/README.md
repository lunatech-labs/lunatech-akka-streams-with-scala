## Implement an Infinite Impulse Response Filter

This exercise sets the stage for the next one in which you will
implement the core part of an IIR filter.

You will pull the other parts of the implementation, the tests and
a main program that will run a sample audio stream through a 3-stage
IIR filter. Execute the following steps:

- Save whatever work in progress you have by running the `saveState`
  command from the sbt prompt.
  
- Pull the code by running `pullSolution` from the sbt prompt.

- Run the `nextExercise` command from the sbt prompt followed by
  reading the exercise instructions by running the `man e` command.
